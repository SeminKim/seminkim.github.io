I am **Semin Kim**, a master student at KAIST. Currently I am a member of [**vllab**](https://vllab.kaist.ac.kr), advised by **Prof. Seunghoon Hong**. As an researcher, I am interested in general topics in computer vision, including generative models and implicit neural representations.


For more information, please check my [**CV**](/404).
